In this exercise, you should come up with some software application you use 
(a website, game, or other application) and write a few paragraphs describing 
what data structures you think it uses behind the scenes to make it work.

Dictionary - Hash Map can be used to ease the process of searching for words that
are need defining. As the list of words remains the same using an hash map helps
store, organize and manage the large lists.

Grid based games (Bingo) - A 2d array can be used to store the data values
determining where the pieces of the board are. In the example of Bingo the data
values can place a 1 or 0 on the place where there is or isnt a piece. This can
effectively be used to store the games data values, efficiently managning and
organizing them.

Contacts app - Hash map can be used to ease the process of searching for names
of people which need to be contacted. As the list of words remains the same until
another name is specifically added, using a hash map helps store, organize and
manage the large lists.
