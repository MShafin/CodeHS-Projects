//RPM The Restaurant Price Manager

//RMP is a easy to use, cost managing program which helps you keep track of how much
//money need to give, every time you eat out. The user can add their dishes, apply discounts
//or tips, as well as divide the bill with friends. Whatever you need RPM is their to help.

//Global Variables - can be modified and edited from different functions
var ORDER = []; //stores the users total order
var COST = 0; //without tip, tax, discount, should remain that way
var newCOST = 0; //cost with tip and discount, should remain that way
var TIP_RATE = 0; //whole number, user input
var DISCOUNT_RATE = 0; //whole number, user input
var TAX_RATE = 0.1;//can be updated, in deciaml -> in real life, based off time/location
